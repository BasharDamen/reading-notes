called as Relational Databases (RDBMS);|called as non-relational or distributed database.
are table based databases |are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores. 
SQL databases have predefined schema | dynamic schema for unstructured data
are vertically scalable | horizontally scalable. 
uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerfu | , queries are focused on collection of documents.


1.  SQL databases are good for the complex query intensive environment
2.  MySQL database
3.  large data sets
4.  Hbase
5.  NoSQL
6.  NoSQL
   
=======================================================

1. Structured Query Language
2. A database that relies on relations between data inorder to retrieve data queries.

3. Data in table structure
4. The requirements for what data can be stored in the tables.
5. is a type of database that stores and retrieves data without needing to define its structure first.
6. You query the data you need directly from collections instead of looking for relations between data.
7. It stores data as collections, where each collection is made of documents.
8. MongoDB, it doesnâ€™t rely on relations between data, but on the keys you require.
9. You can have duplicated data, and data needs to be updated everywhere when it changes.
