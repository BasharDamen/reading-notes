## What is functional programming?

Functional programming is a programming paradigm a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data .

## What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
-It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
-It does not cause any observable side effects


## What are the benefits of a pure function?

The code’s definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything. So we can unit test pure functions with different contexts:
- Given a parameter A → expect the function to return value B
- Given a parameter C → expect the function to return value D
A simple example would be a function to receive a collection of numbers and expect it to increment each element of this collection.

## What is immutability?
When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.
In Javascript we commonly use the for loop. This next for statement has some mutable variables.

## What is Referential transparency?
Passing 2 as a parameter of the square function will always returns 4. So now we can replace the square(2) with 4. That's it! Our function is referentially transparent.
Basically, if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.
`pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency`


## What is a module?


Modules are small-ish certain packages of code and js files that we can use to do specific things, we use them so we don't have to download a metric ton of code every time, and instead, just get this comparatively small number of files.

## What does the word ‘require’ do?

ript module into a Node. js application, you can simply use the require() method.
The require() method is used to load and cache JavaScript modules. So, if you want to load a local, relative JavaScript module into a Node. js application, you can simply use the require() method.

## How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

by assigning a variable to whatever require gets from the modules.

## What do we have to do to make a module available?

you first have to export it, using module.export = function;
