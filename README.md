Hello everyone,
my name is _Bashar Al-Damen_, I graduated last year with a bachelor degree in accounting.
I've been always passionate about programming, so I'm looking forward to learn more and more about it.
My next goal is to mix my knowledge in accounting with what I will learn in programming, hopefully to be able to bring a creative ideas to the table.
