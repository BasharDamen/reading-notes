
1. 
`100’s` =These are informational status codes; they usually tell the client that the header part of the request has been received and the server will try to comply with a transmission demand of the client. Like using a different protocol or telling the client that its request will fail before they start sending the body.


`200’s` =These are the success codes. They tell the client that its request was accepted.  

`300’s` =These are redirection codes. They tell the client that the resource they are requesting isn’t available at the expected location anymore   

`400’s` =These are the client error codes. They are all about invalid requests a client sent to a server.  

`500’s` =These are the server error codes. Often they indicate problems with overwhelmed servers or unreachable servers behind proxies, but sometimes they can be directly related to client requests that trigger error exceptions on the server

2. Accepted - If the update is done asynchronous, this code can be used. It should include an URL to access the updated resource or an URL to check if the update has been succeeded. It can also include an estimation of how long the update will take.

3. Permanent Redirect - If we have nested resources `/user/kay/comments/456` and `/posts/123/comments/456`; and a root resource `/comments/456` it can make things easier to simply issue 308 redirects at the nested resources with the Location header field pointed to the root resource so not every endpoint needs a delivery implementation.
4. 204 No Content
5. 410
6. 403 Forbidden - The client has authorized or doesn’t need to authorize itself, but still has no permissions to access the resource.



## Why do we need to pull our MongoDB database string out of our server and put it into our .env?
 not allow others to use it or steal it, for any unethical  or economy purpose.

## What is middleware?
Functions that have access to the request object ( req ), the response object ( res ), and the next function in the application’s request-response cycle.


 ## What does app.use(express.json()) do?

`express.json()` is a method inbuilt in express to recognize the incoming Request Object as a JSON Object

## What does the /:id mean in a route?
The route will be the passed id argument in the middleware function.

## What is the difference beween PUT and PATCH?
PUT requires the client to send an entire representation of a resource to update it. (Replace the old one with the new one)
Patch requires the client only send parts of the representation of the resource to update it. (Add, update or delete these parts in the old version)

## How do you make a defalut value in a schema?
Create an object-like data model within it with key name and value data type.

## What does a 500 error status code mean?
Internal Server Error..


## What is the difference between a status 200 and a status 201?

200: OK, it’s the basic status code to tell the client everything went good.
201: Created, the most fitting for Create operations. This code should signal backend-side resource creation and come along with a Location header that defines the most specific URL for that newly created resource.
