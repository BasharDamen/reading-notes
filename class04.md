### Link to other Sites ###   

> When you link to a different website, the value of the href attribute will be the full web address for the site, which is known as an absolute URL.  

  


### Link to Other Pages on The Same Site ###

Using this way, you do not need to specifiy the **DOMAIN** name in the URL. You will only need to use a ***relative*** URL.
