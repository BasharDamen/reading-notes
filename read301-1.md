## What is a component ?

A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.

A software component can be defined as a unit of composition with a contractually specified interface and explicit context dependencies only. That is, a software component can be deployed independently and is subject to composition by third parties.

### charactistics of a component?

- **Reusability** : Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

- **Replaceable** : Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

- **Not context specific** :Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.
- **Extensible** : A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.
- **Encapsulated** : A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.
- **Independent** : Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components. 


### advantages of using component based architecture?

1) *Ease of deployment* : As new compatible versions become available, it is easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.

2) *Reduced cost* : The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.

3)*Ease of development* : Components implement well-known interfaces to provide defined functionality, allowing development without impacting other parts of the system.

4)*Reusable* : The use of reusable components means that they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.

5) *Modification of technical complexity* :A component modifies the complexity through the use of a component container and its services.

6) *Reliability* : The overall system reliability increases since the reliability of each individual component enhances the reliability of the whole system via reuse.


## What is Props ?

`Props` is a special keyword in React, which stands for **properties** and is being used for passing data from one component to another.

### How are props used in React?

1- Firstly, define an attribute and its value(data)
2- Then pass it to child component(s) by using Props
3- Finally, render the Props Data



**uni-directional flow**. (one way from parent to child).

##JSX

It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.
