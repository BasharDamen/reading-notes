# Thinking in React

* ## How would you break a mock into a component heirarchy?

The first thing you have to do is to draw boxes around every component and subcomponent in the mock and naming them.

* ## What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?

is a computer-programming principle that states that every module, class or function in a computer program should have responsibility over a single part of that program's functionality, and it should encapsulate that part. All of that module, class or function's services should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility, that is, a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.

* ## What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?  

that mean building a coopmonents that uses other components and passes data using *props*. Building static version of your application also mean not to use *state* in building your app.  

* ## What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?

to figure out, we should as three questions :

1. Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.
2. Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
3. Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.


* ## How can you identify where state needs to live?

to answer this question, we should follow these steps:

for each pice of state in the app, we should :

* Identify every component that renders something based on that state

* Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).

* Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.

* If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.
