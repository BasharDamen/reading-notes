# Introductory HTML and JavaScript

Before we talk about HTML and JS, let us briefly demonstrate how the web get accessed by the users by talking about **BROWSERS** and **WEB SERVERS** .

* #### Browsers ####  
  Browser or web browser is a software that is used to access the websites. such as _Chrome_, _Internet Explorer_, and _Opera_.  
  

* #### WEB SERVER ####
  Web Server is a computer or a set of computers that host the website. These computers are constantly connected to the Internet, and are optimized to send web pages out to people who request them.  

Let's get started!  

## HTML ##
  HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used for strucuring or desicribing the structure of a web page.
  Structuring web page is like giving a special order to the page's content such as dividing the page for **Headlines**, **Paragraphs**, **qoates**, and so on. This is similar to newspaper structure but as an electronic versions.

  * **HTML ELEMENTS :**  
    Are HTML codes that being containd iside angled brackets (Called tags). These elements are like a descriptor that describe the information between the opening and closing tags to the browser.
    The elements are usually made of two tages:  
    1- opening tag. `<>`
    2- closing tag. `</>`

    The following table contains some html tages:  

    |tag | description
    |:--:|
    | <!DOCTYPE>| Defines the document type
    | <header>  | Defines a header for a document or section
    | <body>    | Defines the document's body
    | <html>    | Defines the root of an HTML document 
    | <link>    | Defines the relationship between a document and an external resource.
    | <table>   | Defines a table
    | <div>     | Defines a section in a document


  

  * **ATTRIBUTES :**  
    Attributes support the contents of the element with additional information. They can be used by adding them to the opening tag of the element and are consist of two parts - name & - value and an equal sign between them.

HTML has been improved to a better versions with the passage of time. In 1997, **HTML 4** was released and had some presentational elements to control the appearace of pages. Anyway, they are not recommended to be used anymore. By 1998, a language called **XML** was published, which aims to allow people to write new markup languages.
In 2000, XHTML1.0 was released, which is a reformulation of HTML 4. In XHTMl, authors had to follow some new syntaxes an writing markup, for example:

  * **closing tag** is needed for every element except for empty elements such as `<ing/>`.
  * **Attribute names** had to be in lowercase
  * All **Attributes** required value, and all values were to be placed in double quots.
  * **Deprecated elements** should no longer be used.
  * Every element that was opened inside another element should be closed inside that same element.

Morefurther, two main flavers of HTML 1.0 were created to help authors move to new syntax: **Strict XHTML 1.0** and **Transitional XHTML 1.0**.

In 2000, **HTML 5** also was released, in which authors do not need to close all tags, and new elements and attributes will be introduced.
