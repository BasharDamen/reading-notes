# Basics of HTML, CSS & JS  

## TEXT ##
While working on a web page using HTML language, tags (known as markup) are added to the content of the page in which these tags provide extra meaning and give the ability to browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page.  
The two markup types we will explain them are:  
    1- Structural markup.  
    2- Semmantic markup.

### **1- Structural Markup** ###  
The elements that can be used to describe both *headings* and *paragraphs*.

- **HEADINGS:**
There are six types or levels of headings in HTML:
```
 <h1> is used for the main headings
 <h2> is used for subheadings
 <h3>, <h4>,<h5>, <h6> are used in case if there are a further subheadings
```  
Contents are being displayed by the browser at different sizes.

- **PARAGRAPHS**
Paragrapgh tags is being surrounding the words that make up the paragrapgh. For example:

```
<p> This is a paragrapgh This is a paragrapgh This is a paragrapgh This is a paragrapgh This is a paragrapgh This is a paragrapgh This is a paragrapgh This is a paragrapgh This is a paragrapgh</p>
```

<p> This is a paragrapgh This is a paragrapgh This is a paragrapgh This is a paragrapgh This is a paragrapgh This is a paragrapgh This is a paragrapgh This is a paragrapgh This is a paragrapgh </p>     






- **BOLD & *ITALIC*:**  
Texts can be styled in HTML using:  
    `<b>..</b>` ---> to make the characters appear **bold**.  
    `<i>..</i>` ---> to make the character appear *italic*.  

- **SUPERSCRIPT & SUBSCRIPT**  

    1- `<sup>`: an element used to contain character that should be superscript.  
    2- `<sub>`: an element used to contain character that should be subscript.  

    Example:   
    `<h2> this is an example for<sup>sup</sup> and<sub>sub</sub></h2>`  
    Result:  

    <h2> this is an example for<sup>sup</sup> and<sub>sub</sub></h2>  

- **WHITE SPACE**  
    This is a way where authors used to make it easier to read the code, and this can be done by adding extra spaces or starting some elements on new lines.

- **Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules**  
    `<br />`: is used to make add a line break in middle of paragrapg.  
    Example :  
    `<p>This is how to use <br /> LINE BREAK</p>`
    <p>This is how to use <br /> LINE BREAK</p>  

    `<hr />`: is used creat a break between themes.  
    Example:  
```
    <p> Theme 1 </p>
   <hr />
    <p> Theme 2 </p>
```  

<p> Theme 1 </p>
