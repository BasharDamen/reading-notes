# HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model  





## HTML Lists ##   
HTML has a 3 types of lists to use:  
    1- Orderd lists.  
    2- Unorderd lists.    
    3- Definition lists.    

### Orderd Lists ###  
By using **ordered lists**, each item listed will be numbered. This type of lists can be use to list a set of steps of a process.  

To make an ordered list you should use `<ol>..</ol>` element, and put `<li>..</li>` to creat a listed ordered item.  

```
<ol>
    <li> list a</li>
    <li> list  y</li>
    <li> list  x</li>
</ol>
```
```
1. list   
2. list   
3. list   
```

### Unordered Lists ###  
In this type of lists, the lists begin with a bulllet point rather than a number.  

Unordered lists can be created using `<ul>..</ul>` element. And between the opening and closing tag we can add the items we want to list them using `<li>..</li>` element.  

```
<ul>
    <li> list a </li>
    <li> list y </li>
    <li> list x </li>
</ul>
```
```
* list a
* list y
* list x  
```

### Definition Lists ###  
This type of lists represents a term and a relevant description in the form of the list.  
HTML definition list element starts with `<dl>` as opening tag and ends with `</dl>` element.  
The terms are enclosed with `<dt> term </dt>` element.  
The description is enclosed with the `<dd> description </dd>` element.  

```
<dl>
    <dt> Term 1 </dt>
    <dd> definition definition definition definition definition definition definition definition definition </dd>
    <dt> Term 2 </dt>
    <dd> definition2 definition2 definition2 definition2 definition2 definition2 definition2 definition2 </dd>
</dl>
```  
```
Term 1      
    definition definition definition definition definition definition definition definition definition   

Term 2  
    definition2 definition2 definition2 definition2 definition2 definition2 definition2 definition2 
```  

### Nested Lists ###  
Using HTML, you can put a list inside a list in order to make a sub-list.

## Boxess in CSS ##  

### Boxes Dimensions ###  
By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents. To set your own dimensions for a box you can use the height and width properties.

![demensions](https://openhome.cc/eGossip/JavaScript/images/ElementDimensions-2.png)

You can eith use Percentages or pixles to control a box size.

```
header{
    width = 80%;
    height = 60 %;
}

div{
    width = 150px;
    height = 200px;
}
```

### Limiting Width and Height ###  
Some page designs expand and shrink to fit the size of the user's screen. In such designs, the min-width property specifies the smallest size a box can be displayed at when the browser window is narrow, and the max-width property indicates the maximum width a box can stretch to when the browser window is wide.  
In the same way that you might
want to limit the width of a box
on a page, you may also want
to limit the height of it. This is
achieved using the min-height
and max-height properties.
```
article P{
    min-width: 450px;
    max-width: 650px;
    text-align: left;
    min-height: 10px;
    max-height: 30px;
    padding: 5px;
    margin: 0px;
}
```

### Overflowing Content ###  
`overflow`  

The overflow property tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger than the box itself. It can have one of two values:  

1. `hidden`
    It is used to hide any extra content that does not fit in the box.  

2. `scroll`  
    This one is used to add a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll to see the missing content.

    ```
    article#p1{
        overflow: hidden;
    }
    article#p2{
        overflow: scroll;
    }
    ```

## Arrays in JavaScript ##

An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.

Array is helpful and should be taken in consider whenever working with a **list** or a set of values that are **related** to each other.

Arrays are helpful when you don't know how many items a list will contain becausem when you creat the array, you do not need to specify how many values it will hold.
