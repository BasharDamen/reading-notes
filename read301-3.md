## Lists and keys

we use the map() function to take an array of numbers and double their values

#### What does .map() return?

 a map object(which is an iterator) of the results after applying the given function to each item of a given iterable

 #### If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?

 By .map() , for loop or forEach

 Each list item needs a unique ____.


#### What is the purpose of a key?

 Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.


 ## The Spread Operator

  **spread operator** : The spread operator is a useful and quick syntax for adding items to arrays, combining arrays or objects, and spreading an array out into a function’s arguments.JavaScript, spread syntax refers to the use of an ellipsis of three dots to expand an iterable object into the list of arguments.

  **spread operator is useful for many different routine tasks in JavaScript, including the following:** 

  1- Copying an array

  2-Concatenating or combining arrays

  3-Using Math functions

  4-Using an array as arguments

  #### an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one :
```
  const objectOne = {hello: "🤪"}
  const objectTwo = {world: "🐻"}
  const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: "😂"}
  console.log(objectThree) // Object { hello: "🤪", world: "🐻", laugh: "😂" }
const objectFour = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: () => {console.log("😂".repeat(5))}}
objectFour.laugh() // 😂😂😂😂😂
```
- the developer does to pass functions between components by state values to a child component as a prop, but you can also pass functions directly to the child component.

- ***the Increment function *** : The Increment( ) function determines the next node at the same level. You can also increase the level of a node by one at a specified level.

- child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component  ,You can pass state values to a child component as a prop, but you can also pass functions directly to the child component like this:
