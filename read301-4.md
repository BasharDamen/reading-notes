# React and Forms

## Forms

The form has the default HTML form behavior of browsing to a new page when the user submits the form. If you want this behavior in React, it just works. But in most cases, it’s convenient to have a JavaScript function that handles the submission of the form and has access to the data that the user entered into the form. The standard way to achieve this is with a technique called “controlled components”.

### What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

In HTML, form elements such as `< input>`, `< textarea >`, and `< select>` typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with `setState()`.

We can combine the two by making the React state be the “single source of truth”. Then the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “***controlled component***”.

Example:

-With a controlled component, the input’s value is always driven by the React state. While this means you have to type a bit more code, you can now pass the value to other UI elements too, or reset it from other event handlers.

-In HTML, an `<input type="file">` lets the user choose one or more files from their device storage to be uploaded to a server or manipulated by JavaScript via the File API.

`<input type="file" />`
Because its value is read-only, it is an uncontrolled component in React. It is discussed together with other uncontrolled components later in the documentation.



## ternary operator

### Why would we use a ternary operator?

to simplify your if-else statements that are used to assign values to variables. 

X===Y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false)
