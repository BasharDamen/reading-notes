## What is a ‘call’?

function invocation

## How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?
It is single-threaded. Meaning it can only do one thing at a time.

## What does LIFO mean?

Last In, First Out (LIFO), which temporarily stores and manages function invocation (call), and solves the last function that was called.


## Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.


When secondFunction() gets executed, an empty stack frame is created. It is the main (anonymous) entry point of the program.
secondFunction() then calls firstFunction()which is pushed into the stack.
firstFunction() returns and prints “Hello from firstFunction” to the console.
firstFunction() is pop off the stack.
The execution order then move to secondFunction().
secondFunction() returns and print “The end from secondFunction” to the console.
secondFunction() is pop off the stack, clearing the memory.

## What causes a Stack Overflow?

A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error.


## What is a ‘refrence error’?

 thrown when a code attempts to reference a non-existing variable
## What is a ‘syntax error’?

I know it’s in the name of the errors, but like it says itself, this occurs when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax, like when you try to parse an invalid object using JSON.parse.

## What is a ‘range error’?

Try to manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length and this kind of error will show up.

## What is a ‘tyep error’?
The TypeError object represents an error when an operation could not be performed, typically (but not exclusively) when a value is not of the expected type. A TypeError may be thrown when: an operand or argument passed to a function is incompatible with the type expected by that operator or function


## What is a breakpoint?


The breakpoint can also be achieved by putting a debugger statement in your code in the line you want to break.

## What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?
The breakpoint can also be achieved by putting a debugger statement in your code in the line you want to break.You can run the debugger by pressing F5 or pressing the green play button.
