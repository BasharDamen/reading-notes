## React Lifecycle

These methods are called in the following order when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM:

- constructor()
- static getDerivedStateFromProps()
- render()
- componentDidMount()

**Note** : from this diagram the ‘render’ happens first, the‘componentDidMount’ and the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React is constructor.

Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting are the three phases of the component lifecycle.

- **Mounting** : When an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM it occurs during the mounting phase. Constructor, static getDerivedStateFromProps, render, componentDidMount, and UNSAFE_componentWillMount all occur in this order during mounting.

- **Updating** :Anytime a component is updated or state changes then it is rerendered. These lifecycle events happen during updating in this order.

static getDerivedStateFromProps, shouldComponentUpdate, render,
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate, componentDidUpdate, UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate, UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps.

- **Unmounting** :The final phase of the lifecycle if called when a component is being removed from the DOM. componentWillUnmount is the only lifecycle event during this phase.

#### This is the order of what happens first : 

1- constructor
2- render
3- componentDidMount
4- React Updates
5- componentWillUnmount

#### componentDidMount()

This method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted. If you need to load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM, it should go here. This method is a good place to set up any subscriptions.

 If you do that, don’t forget to unsubscribe in componentWillUnmount().
setState() can be called here, but it should be used sparingly, because it will cause a rerender, which can lead to perfomance issues.
Here we use componentDidMount() to connect to the YouTube API and get videos when the components is rendered.

## React Bootstrat Documentation

**Rebuilt with React**
***React-Bootstrap*** replaces the Bootstrap JavaScript. Each component has been built from scratch as a true React component, without unneeded dependencies like jQuery.

As one of the oldest React libraries, React-Bootstrap has evolved and grown alongside React, making it an excellent choice as your UI foundation.

1- **Installation**

The best way to consume React-Bootstrap is via the npm package which you can install with npm (or yarn if you prefer).

If you plan on customizing the Bootstrap Sass files, or don't want to use a CDN for the stylesheet, it may be helpful to install vanilla Bootstrap as well.

`npm install react-bootstrap@next bootstrap@5.0.2`

2- **Importing Components**

You should import individual components like: react-bootstrap/Button rather than the entire library. Doing so pulls in only the specific components that you use, which can significantly reduce the amount of code you end up sending to the client.

`import Button from 'react-bootstrap/Button';`

3- **Browser globals**

We provide react-bootstrap.js and react-bootstrap.min.js bundles with all components exported on the window.ReactBootstrap object. These bundles are available on unpkg, as well as in the npm package.

## React State Vs Props

 pass values from a parent component down to a child component. The values can be any data type, from strings to functions, objects.


#### What is the big difference between props and state?

props you pass into a component and state is handled inside of that component and props  is handled outside of that component

#### When do we re-render our application?

whenever there is a change in their state or props.

#### What are some examples of things that we could store in state?

This state can be passed down to children as props, which allows you to separate your components between smart data-components and dumb presentational-components if you chose.
